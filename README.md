## Requirements

- This is version is specifically build for MacOS ARM64 with FFmpeg6 with headers and shared libraries
- libargtable2 for option parsing
- Optional: SDL for building the Comskip GUI

### TODO
[ ] Native GUI and drop SDL dependency
[ ] Remove all code and configuration for other systems than MacOS
[ ] Rewrite mpeg2dec to eliminate deprecated functions




### Setting up a build environment

First install Xcode (freely available from the Mac OS X App Store). After it's installed, install the Xcode command-line tools by executing `xcode-select --install` from a terminal.

Recommended way to install dependencies is MacPorts. 
```
sudo port -v install autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig argtable ffmpeg6 libsdl coreutils

```
### Installation
Due to bug in FFmpeg6 not providing required `mem_internal.h` file in MacPorts
installation I attached it here. Copy this to
`/opt/local/libexec/ffmpeg6/include/libavutil` and run `bash autogen.sh && ./configure &&
make`
